# URGENT
# THIS APP IS UNDERGOING A JAVA MIGRATION


## So... what is this?

Well, this is an api which lets the client request a verse from the [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/h/r1/lp-e) website. ^\_^

Just to make completely clear this is not made by the organisation but rather this is just something that I thought was a good idea and hence am working on. :)

## Features

At the current moment in time this api only gets verses in a single language (English).
And that's it really... for now ^\_~

## The Future?

Hopefully I can expand on this concept to something ✨ amazing ✨ that plenty of people can benefit from.

Possible ideas:

-   The obvious one, duhhh, would be to allow for different languages.
-   Maybe show the footnotes of the verses and cross references.
-   Check the discussions for more!
