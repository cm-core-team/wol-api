## So... what is this?

Well, this is an api which lets the client request a verse from the [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/h/r1/lp-e) website. ^\_^

## Features

At the current moment in time this api only gets verses in a single language (English).
And that's it really... for now ^\_~

## The Future?

Hopefully I can expand on this concept to something ✨ amazing ✨ which plenty of people can benefit from.

Possible ideas:

- The obvious one, duhhh, would be to allow for different languages.
- Maybe show the footnotes of the verses and cross references.
- Check the discussions for more!
